<h1>Median Housing Price Prediction by Building a Machine Learning Model</h1>
<p>The task you are asked to perform is to build a
model of housing prices in California using the California census data. This data has metrics such as the
population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. Block
groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block
group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). We will just call them “districts” for short.</p>
<p>Your model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district,
given all the other metrics.</p>
